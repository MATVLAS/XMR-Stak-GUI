# XMR-Stak-GUI
This is a simple GUI for "hotswapping" miner configurations in XMR-Stak running on Windows.

I made this because I wanted to be able to easily swap between two mining configurations... one for my GTX 970 and one for my GTX 1080 + GTX 970.

# Usage
Read [the wiki](https://github.com/WilliamVenner/XMR-Stak-GUI/wiki) to learn how to use XMR-Stak GUI.
